Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Eduardo,

I am writing to you from a brazen spaceship in a scrumptious galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a maroon rocket in march. There are 789,152 puppies and kids of coffee here! In the
living room there is a pool full of water. I fall asleep each night on a Beautiful bed of
Sand and dream of Jump Slowly. It feels as though I have lived here for
125 minutes. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
Surf on a  new Sedan!!

Best wishes,
Shashi
